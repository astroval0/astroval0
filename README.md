## **Game developer & polyglot coder since 2017.**  
Living in JetBrains IDEs, pushing most of my work to **GitLab**. 

I dive into everything tech; custom bootloaders, roms, firmware hacks, OS mods, PCB tinkering, game mods, penetration testing, reverse engineering and anticheat systems. I learn insanely fast and have a compulsion to tear into everything just to see how it works.

Most of my projects stay private - they're usually short lived experiments - but I'll be open sourcing most my past work on here or gitlab soon :P

## Core Stack

| Java | **6** | Old MC shit usually |

## Tooling
