Obsessed with how shit works under the hood. I prefer to use C++/C# and Rust but can flex to JS or Kotlin/Java when suited.

### Some of the more interesting shit I've done

*   **Project: SpectreRevival (WIP):** Currently reviving the shut down tac fps *Spectre Divide*. I'm reverse engineering the client and rebuilding its entire metagame backend from scratch. I've already finished a static response server in Kotlin which allows me to enter the main menu lobby and mess around with stuff, and I'm now building the fully dynamic C++ version and the dedicated servers with `@OhmV-IR` to bring the game back online, all just for funsies because i like the game.

*   **Hunting Cheaters:** Worked directly with the devs at **Mountaintop Studios (Spectre Divide)** to build an intelligence platform that hunted and exposed cheaters. It was a full stack web and discord system for tracking cheating players and their communities. We caught a shit ton of them. I also started (with the help of mountaintop & some community peeps) "SpectrePD", creating a moderated pipeline for community reports to reach the developers.

*   **Breaking Shit (Respectfully):** I love to tear software apart. I've bypassed commercial antitamper solutions like **Theia**, written custom **x64dbg plugins** to debug protected games, and even modded network adapters with a soldering iron for better wireless penetration testing. For fun, I reversed Spectre Divide's encryption, ripped unreleased assets, and wrote MITM proxies to fuck with the game client mid flight (clientside, of course).

*   **Building My Own Jarvis:** Built a fullstack AI assistant from the ground up, all selfhosted. A Kotlin app on my phone talks to my own OpenWakeWord/ASR servers, which then speak to a custom **Rust router** I wrote to handle logic and pick the most cost-effective LLM. The response comes back through a realistic TTS voice, all with minimal latency.

*   **Game Dev From Scratch:** I like to build my own tools. I wrote a custom **'NPC engine' in Rust** (a bit like Skyrim Creation Kit's npc creation system) for a nice way to speed up my workflow. I've also built everything from a complex networked enemy AI in Unity to a fullbody VR InverseKinematic system with very interactive physics in UE5 (mix of cpp and bp).

I learn insanely fast. I use GitLab for my private work because their CI is just better.
