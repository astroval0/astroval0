17 // United Kingdom

Obsessed with how shit works under the hood.

Ive been coding since I was around 8-9 years old, and was introduced to it at around 5 :D

I used to do a lot of full-stack and a small amount of web dev. Currently focusing on gameplay programming in Unreal Engine and software engineering in C++.
