## **Game developer & polyglot coder since 2017.**  
Living in JetBrains IDEs, pushing most of my work to **GitLab**. 

I've dabbled in many areas of tech, pretty much every corner there is, whether that be making custom bootloaders, roms, modding firmware, modding operating systems, hacking, penetration testing, modding, arduinos, reverse engineering, anticheat etc etc

I usually keep everything i make private because its never maintained or used for long, Ill upload all my previous projects here or on gitlab at some point though :P

## Core Stack
| Language | Skill (1-10) | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Kotlin | **7** | Primary choice for JVM + Minecraft Modding |
| JavaScript / TypeScript | **8** | Full-stack |
| C# | **8** | Unity & backend services |
| Java | **6** | Old MC shit usually |
| C++ | **5** | Unreal Engine |
| Rust | **4** | certain backend shit |

*Past lives:* Lua, Python, and more Java.

## Tooling
- **JetBrains power-user** (IDEA, Rider, Webstorm, RustRover, CLion etc)
- Gradle, npm
- Docker, GitLab CI/CD

## If you vibecode anything besides a throwaway tool only youâ€™ll ever touch, please stay away from me.
